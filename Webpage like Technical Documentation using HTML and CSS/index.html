            <h2>What’s New In Python 3.12</h2>
            <p>Python 3.12 is the latest stable release of the Python programming language, with a mix of changes to the
                language and the standard library. The library changes focus on cleaning up deprecated APIs, usability,
                and correctness. Of note, the distutils package has been removed from the standard library. Filesystem
                support in os and pathlib has seen a number of improvements, and several modules have better
                performance.</p>

            <p>The language changes focus on usability, as f-strings have had many limitations removed and ‘Did you mean
                …’ suggestions continue to improve. The new type parameter syntax and type statement improve ergonomics
                for using generic types and type aliases with static type checkers.</p>

            <p>This article doesn’t attempt to provide a complete specification of all new features, but instead gives a
                convenient overview. For full details, you should refer to the documentation, such as the Library
                Reference and Language Reference. If you want to understand the complete implementation and design
                rationale for a change, refer to the PEP for a particular new feature; but note that PEPs usually are
                not kept up-to-date once a feature has been fully implemented.</p>

            <h2>The Python Standard Library</h2>
            <p>While The Python Language Reference describes the exact syntax and semantics of the Python language, this
                library reference manual describes the standard library that is distributed with Python. It also
                describes some of the optional components that are commonly included in Python distributions.</p>

            <p>Python’s standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of facilities as indicated by the long
                table of contents listed below. The library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access
                to system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to Python programmers, as
                well as modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in
                everyday programming. Some of these modules are explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the
                portability of Python programs by abstracting away platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs.</p>

            <p>The Python installers for the Windows platform usually include the entire standard library and often also
                include many additional components. For Unix-like operating systems Python is normally provided as a
                collection of packages, so it may be necessary to use the packaging tools provided with the operating
                system to obtain some or all of the optional components.</p>

            <h2>Packaging Python libraries and tools</h2>
            <p>You may have heard about PyPI, setup.py, and wheel files. These are just a few of the tools Python’s
                ecosystem provides for distributing Python code to developers, which you can read about in Packaging and
                distributing projects.</p>

            <p>The following approaches to packaging are meant for libraries and tools used by technical audience in a
                development setting. If you’re looking for ways to package Python for a non-technical audience and/or a
                production setting, skip ahead to Packaging Python applications.</p>

            <p>A Python file, provided it only relies on the standard library, can be redistributed and reused. You will
                also need to ensure it’s written for the right version of Python, and only relies on the standard
                library.

                This is great for sharing simple scripts and snippets between people who both have compatible Python
                versions (such as via email, StackOverflow, or GitHub gists). There are even some entire Python
                libraries that offer this as an option, such as bottle.py and boltons.

                However, this pattern won’t scale for projects that consist of multiple files, need additional
                libraries, or need a specific version of Python, hence the options below.</p>

            <h2>Python Packaging Authority</h2>
            <p>The Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) is a working group that maintains a core set of software projects
                used in Python packaging.</p>

            <p>The software developed through the PyPA is used to package, share, and install Python software and to
                interact with indexes of downloadable Python software such as PyPI, the Python Package Index. Click the
                logo below to download pip, the most prominent software used to interact with PyPI.</p>

            <img src="pypi-logo.svg" height="200px" width="200px">

            <p>The PyPA publishes the Python Packaging User Guide, which is the authoritative resource on how to
                package, publish, and install Python projects using current tools. The User Guide provides a user
                introduction to packaging, and explains how to use these tools. In case you need to package Python with
                other languages (for example, in a scientific Python package), the user guide also offers basic
                information about and links to available third-party packaging options (for example, conda-forge).</p>
